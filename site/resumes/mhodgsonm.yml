    summary: |
        I’m a Software Marketing Engineer focused on AI-first automation and revenue systems engineering. I design and build end-to-end growth systems that connect acquisition, nurture, and conversion through clean funnel architecture, lifecycle messaging, CRM workflows, and measurable analytics. My work blends marketing strategy with a builder mindset—using automation, data, and lightweight code to turn scattered efforts into repeatable processes that scale. I thrive in high-trust environments where clarity and accuracy matter, translating complex ideas into simple systems that teams can actually run.
